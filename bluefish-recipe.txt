Ingredients:
 - Several red or yukon gold potatoes (1-2 potatoes per person, +1 extra), cut into 1/2" cubes
 - Artichoke heart quarters, canned in water, drained
 - 1 small onion, chopped
 - 1 red bell pepper, chopped
 - 2 tbsp olive oil
 - Salt & pepper
 - Bluefish fillet (1/4 to 1/2 lb per person)

Directions:
 1. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.

 2. Mix everything except the fish in a 9"x13" baking pan (or if you're making a lot,
    use a rimmed baking sheet). Spread the contents of the pan to form a single layer.
    Bake for 20 minutes, then stir the vegetables.

 3. Bake for another 10 minutes and then test a potato to see if it's close to done.
    If not, bake for 5 min at a time until potatoes are almost done the way you'd like.

 4. Lay the bluefish skin-side-up on the potato mixture. Bake for 8-10 minutes, and
    then test by sticking a fork in the thickest part of the fish and giving it a
    gentle twist. If the fish flakes easily, it's done. If not, bake 2 more minutes
    at a time until it passes this test.
